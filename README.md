# Quoted Tweet Flattener
This repository contains a prototype of flattening module of quoted tweet chains, developed with Python 3.x.



## 1. What does this do?



Sometimes on Twitter, there can be a "nested" quoted tweets. From almost every apps, you have to click or touch the quoted tweets if that tweet has another quoted tweet, and it generates a headache driven by quoted tweet hell.

This app is to flatten those quote chains and show the chain in a user-friendly form.



## 2. TODO

- Add parsing: url-to-status_id

- Add frontend: Flask & Bootstrap(maybe)
